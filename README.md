Personality World Interactive Game.<br>
<br>
I worked on an interactive magical world game driven by player personality and choices. Inspired by two of my recent interests.

Concept and Inspiration <br>
<br> 
I used JS, HTML and CSS to create a game where the user selects multiple choices to be told how peaceful their world is. The personality type was initially so I could make subtle judgements based on what they enter, but I had to cut that short as things started getting complicated and I got burnt out; I'll expand on this in my challenges part.<br>
The questions were magically and whimsically inspired by a book I recently read: The Ex Hex by Erin Sterling. I'm happy that my original world peace idea was able to be implemented.
<br>
The concept came about when I was bothering my dog at home, nothing crazy, it just sprung into my head. It was way cooler in my head. Maybe I culd pick up this type of thing again later in my studies, then you'll be able to see what I really wanted to do. Not, just hear about it.
<br>
The Ex Hex also inspired the visuals of my game. The cat was just one I drew because I thought, why not? A bit of original creativity never hurt anyone. Maybe your eyes, but oh well!
<br>
Though upon research, when I browsed more into interactive game, and fiction, Twine inspired me to build my own little one, which you'll see in my research.
<br>
<br>
How it Works
<br>
The player enters their Myers‑Briggs personality type at the start.
<br>
That input doesn’t affect branching logic but gives context, though I would've like to expand it.
<br>
The game gives you 20 world building scenarios and choices (two options).
<br>
Every choice adjusts a peaceScore value, a plus 5, b minus 3; this decides how peaceful or chaotic the world becomes.
<br>
At the end, the final world summary and the peace percentage score is shown, showing the player how their choices shaped their world. The personality type was going to make it more, you guessed it, personalised. But I hope you appreciate the foundation of the game for now, and the personality can still allow the player to reflect in their own way!
<br>
I used HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling/aesthetic and JS for the logic.

<br>
Twine showed that simple HTML/JS can power branching narrative games, validating the idea of my approach. 
<br>
<br>
Articles about personalities helped me reflect on the different personality types. Like how more introspective types are creative and prefer to imagine worlds and emotional landscapes. That influenced why I wanted personality as the entry point for the game.
<br>
Interactive fiction, e.g. Mask of the Rose. Researching this gave me a structural context and the lasting appeal of story/choice games. Very inspiring.
<br>
<br>
What Went Well
<br>
I created a fully working interactive game using just HTML, CSS and basic JS, proving I’ve internalised core coding and web skills from the module and independent research.
<br>
The design is simple sure, but I was creative with the scenarios and points that leads up to world peace percentage.
<br>
The aesthetic really comes together with my cat god, and he resonates perfectly with the magical theme I went forward with.
<br>
Throughout this project, I got lost in a bunch of code, as I previously did research into Python which I didn't need, and tried to make an Earth png spin, which I didn't end up including. Which leads to challenges and what I learned from them.
<br>
<br>
Challenges and what I learned from them:
<br>
There were a few limitations and trade‑offs in this project:
<br>
The personality input doesn't influence the branching logic; it simply gets displayed at the end in a very simple manner. I’d like to make future versions to let personality meaningfully shape story paths, but I started with a simpler baseline to ensure I could deliver a working product in time; you said submitting something is better than nothing.
<br>
The narrative paths are linear, 20 questions, always in chronological order instead of branching in complex networks; this limits replayability and narrative richness. I realised that building a hefty story graph needs more planning and time, which I felt I ran out of. An interactive game  like Mask of the Rose can be done another time!
<br>
Aside from my simple hand-drawn cat, I lack orignal assets and rich media like the assignment wanted. That's my bad. I would've loved to create more, but I really didn't balance time well; it's been a while since I've been in this kind of academic setting, and I'm sure everyone goes through this when they first start uni... I hope.
<br>
Testing, experimenting and debugging handling user input, DOM state transitions, and non‑standard personality strings needed extra attentivesness and care, and created weaknesses that I got too stressed with trying to figure out.
<br>
These challenges taught me a lot about planning, and prioritising, and that I need to be able to balance ambition with deliverability, and create with a structured, thorough plan.
<br>
<br>
Personal Reflection
<br>
This project also taught me the importance of channeling energy, boredom, or existential dread into something tangible and imaginative. During periods of depression or addiction, I've felt like everything is meaningless, and this game was a good distraction when I put more focus into it, and stopped letting it be affected by my shortcomings.
<br>
It also helped me explore my own personality, and it makes me happy that it could encourage other people to have fun and explore their own too.
<br>
So, the game isn't just entertainmen, it’s also a self reflection tool. Yes, a one time play, but something nonetheless. Not to mention, the book that inspired me is cute, would recommend.
<br>
Actually finishing this project proved to me there's still hope, and I'm proud that I accomplished something, no matter how little, and I'm intrigued by what else I can create as time goes on.
<br>
<br>
Future Improvements:
<br>
If I had more time (or want to expand this later), I’d love to:
<br>
Make personality input affect branching logic, like I discussed before, certain personality types unlock different choices or dialogue, or alter how the world or cat god reacts.
<br>
Expand branches so that choices lead to different story paths, so people can replay the game.
<br>
Add more original assets like my creepy hand-drawn cat god. Also animations, sound effects, maybe ambient music to make it all way more entertaining.
<br>
Add variables aside from just the a simple peaceScore. So, I can track morale percentage, relationships with magical creatures, world state changes, and consequences that depend on choices.
<br>
Maybe explore a small JS “engine” for branching narratives.
<br>
<br>
Meeting the Assignment Brief:
<br>
The game is inspired by one of my interests, includes my art style, and explores an imaginary magical world. The concept itself is creative!
<br>
I researched interactive fiction, looked at existing tools, and thought about how personality theory can inform narrative designs and stories.
<br>
I reflected on limitations, design choices, compromises, and the cat and mouse between ambition and tangibility.
<br>
The project structure is tidy and simple, which is different from how I usually experiment. The code is clear, and the README demonstrates awareness of development process, potential problems, and future directions, which is exactly what the brief is looking for.
<br>
Furthermore, this README describes what the project does, where it came from, what inspired it, and also I yapped about a personal story. Like in Xfactor auditions, they have to get yes if they open up. jk jk.
<br>
<br>
Thank you for looking at my project. And like James Halliday said, thank you for playing my (much more basic compared to Ready Player One) game!
